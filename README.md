# Script's Chunk Loaders

> Make minecarts act as chunk loaders using redstone.

All information is [available on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/scripts-chunk-loaders).

üôè Currently the deployment setup for [all of my mods](https://modrinth.com/collection/7JZGuXDg)
(not a lot right now) is quite odd. I can't release older versions easily and I
have to bump the mod version to update the Minecraft version. If you have
experience with Minecraft modding and a good idea of how to automate this in a
better way, please feel free to [reach out](https://github.com/scriptcoded).
